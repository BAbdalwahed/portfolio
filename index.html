    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>An engineer who is always thriving to learn about physics and maths, husband and a father of two, and a Formula One fan.</p>
    <p>I have always loved to know what is behind everything we had in life and how someone managed to deliver such a thing, I liked the black screen and how you can do so much
        with it, until recently in my line of work we started getting heavily involved in measurement data and how to deliver field data to easy access either through mobile phone
        or screen mounted somewhere, so I said to myself I want to be part of this, and here I am on my very first baby steps and willing to make a change in this world.
